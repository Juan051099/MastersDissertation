# MastersDissertation: Tailored design of centroidal Voronoi tessellations.
In this repository you can find the code used in the developing of my master's dissertation called Tailored design of centroidal Voronoi tessellations. You will find three folders in this respository, in the folder lloyd, you will find my implementation for Lloyd's algorithm considering a density function equals to one, recalling that for this case, there exists a closed formula for the centroid, with that information is done the code. You can find this expression in the pdf document of this work. The folder Chapter 4, has all the implementation used to generate the numerical experiments, inside this folder, you are going to find two more: Function J and Function G folders, in these folders you are going to find the developed codes to conduct the numerical experiments with the function J and the function G (function G is the CVT energy function), mentioned in the pdf. Finally in the folder Chapter 5, you will find the codes used for the numerical experiments of this chapter.

If you have any question about, please let me know.
